# Neural Network from Scratch

This project demonstrates how to implement a simple neural network from scratch using Python and NumPy, without relying on high-level libraries like Scikit-learn.

## Features
- Implements a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer.
- Supports classification problems with one-hot encoded targets.
- Uses sigmoid activation functions.

## Files
- `neural_network.py`: Contains the implementation of the neural network.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data loading and preprocessing.
- `train.py`: Script to train the model and evaluate its performance.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
4. Run the training script: `python train.py`.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
